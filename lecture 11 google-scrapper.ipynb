Feeling very frastered about using the Instagram\",\n",

It doesn't show the albums I have created to select photos from not even the photos that I have I clicked on my own camera given I can't share story neither post photos or update my profile picture. Only WhatsApp images and screenshots are available. I've already the reported the issue twice still no response and the app is updated to date.\",\n",

Operators should fix this issue as soon as possible.\",\n",

This inconsistency is concerning, as it does not accurately reflect my actual usage patterns. I rely on the time spent feature to monitor and manage my social media activity.\",\n",

From unexpected crashes to slow loading times, it seems like there are some serious bugs or technical glitches that need to be addressed urgently.I hope to see improvements soon so that I can continue enjoying the platform without interruptions.\",\n",

When we're on a post or reel, reading the comments, and then try to go back to the post, the entire app reloads, showing a new post on the screen. Additionally, on the recommendation page, if we click on a post with multiple images, the first slide won't load unless we slide to the second and then come back to the first again.\",\n",

The internet connection is already at 30-40MBPS. How much more speed do you need. While scrolling through reels the like, comment and sharing button appear anywhere on the side of the screen and not in their designated location. When are these issues going to get fixed?',\n",

My Instagram doesn't load fully and properly. It's stuck. Suppose I click a story to view it, it keeps on loading. Same with some accounts and even my feed. Please look into this. Update: Seems to have been fixed. But a few technical glitches seem to be always there.\",\n",

If I save a reel draft it becomes blank when I publish it. 3. If I choose a cover for my reel from the reel video, it does not include text from the video. 4. And now I have no 30 sec reel option!! I updated my app but still the same. I have reported the problem.',\n",

Although my pixel 6a device allows 3rd party apps to use all the camera sensors and night mode, Instagram doesn't make use of it, still takes the screenshots instead of actually clicking the pictures. There is also a bug that needs to be fixed. If there is a post with multiple pics or videos in it, when we open it the first photo or video goes black. Unless we swipe to the second and come back to the first, the first one will not be visible.\",\n",

No doubt it's a universal BOSS sociàl media app But since last month I'm facing a problem, whenever I open the app and go to the inbox to check or to reply on messages it just shows it's fetchin but i don't see any messages then (I have to clear cache and force stop) once or more than once time then it shows messages. It's happening continuously because of that I feel very frustrated somtimes! Please solve it! Thanks!\",\n",

Every account and phone has a different set of features (even interactive features like notes), some reels have progress bar some don't. While watching reels, video brightness randomly increases to max (Its just the video not the UI) and some videos are stretched vertically. Randomly blackscreens while watching stories (Goes back to normal when you exit stories). All of this is on stable versions. Reinstalling doesn't work either.\",\n",

The trimming and merging features are straightforward to use, and I love how easy it is to add transitions, filters, and music to my videos. The selection of stickers and text options allows me to get creative and add a personal touch to my videos. I highly recommend it.\",\n",

Difficult to hold and slide the navigation bar. 6. First hand experience of heavy shadow banning for silly reasons. Need an alternative app run by creators like Nebula.',\n",

Few of my friends are also facing similar issues. These are leading to huge user experience problems.\",\n",

As a user, I expect better from Instagram. hope they address this problem promptly and streamline their recommendation algorithm to provide a more tailored and engaging experience for all users\",\n",

It's like a never-ending storage nightmare that I can't wake up from So, Instagram, I'm kindly asking for your assistance. Please find a way to free up that space and give my phone some much-needed breathing room\",\n",

The updates are cool, no lies, the app works normal, no bugs and problems, but.. the reels are extremely disappointing as some reels are copied, reposted, and have stolen pov(s). I get annoyed watching the same reels and the reels of same pov. There is no creativity in the creation of the reels. I suggest to kindly add copyrights in stealing the ideas, reposting, etc. I would expect you to carry the work forward in that direction. Thank you.',\n",

It's the worst after you spent so much time working on it and lose everything or can't go further. Editing stories is a nightmare as well. How have they not figured out a better way for us to edit our content within the app?? One of the biggest companies in the world yet they have terrible UX which should be their entire focus.\",\n",

       "  'Endless ads, getting worse every week. In different accounts I manage you folks keep moving the options to share to story, threads and reels, and it\\'s infuriating. Most recently, SD card files (images and videos) are not properly showing up when looking to upload photos or videos, in any format. Only internal memory and older files are showing with some random cutoff date. This is a major bug that needs to be fixed and we need options to \"see all\" and \"see SD\" folders, too!',\n",
       "  \"There is some glitch right now where it doesn't show captions. If you click into the comments and then back out, the it will finally show up but it's super annoying and inconvenient.

If I am not initiating it then I don't want it!\",\n",

Also, a lot of transphobic content that I wouldn't like to see. Wish I could see more of my friend's content and less pages and ads. I deleted cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app (therefore signing in again) and no change. I really hope you get it together and fix this stuff soon, this is embarrassing for a major app\",\n",

I've tried everything to get it to show my photos and videos, but nothing has worked, considering uninstalling and then re-installing it. But posting is the most annoying these days. When you select 'add to story' or 'post' it shows 'error' and you have to re-do it and hope it will be successful (which usually it isn't and you have to reset your device) The app is amazing, just a few bugs.🪲 \\U0001fa77🌸\"],\n",
